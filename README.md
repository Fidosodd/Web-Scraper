# Web-Scraper

Tests whether a website has changed

In order for this to run, you need the Python library Beautiful Soup 4 (bs4)

This program needs 2 arguments to run, an adress and a number of seconds to check for (this isn't going to be perfectly exact)

An example comand is <C:/path>scraper.py https://fidosodd.github.io 20
